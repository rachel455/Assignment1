        Arctic foxes live in Arctic and alpine tundra. 
        They have an average lifespan in the wild of three to six years. 
        They may be around forty-three inches long and weigh 6.5 to 17 pounds. 
        Their thick white fur coat keeps their body warm and makes it easier to camouflage in the ice and snow. 
        Their fur color can change during different times of the year. 
        Their fluffy tails act like a blanket, and their feet have a layer of thick fur. 
        They are omnivores, so they eat rodents, different small mammals, birds, insects, eggs, berries, reptiles, and amphibians.
