    <p> Sea Otters stay alongside the coasts of the Pacific Ocean in North America and Asia. 
        They can live up to 23 years. 
        They are four feet long and weigh sixty five pounds. 
        Sea otters even have thick, brown fur that insulates them in the cold ocean. 
        They have four legs to transport effortlessly on land, and an extended tail to swim through the water. 
        They are carnivores and eat hard-shelled invertebrates, which include sea urchins, clams, mussels, and crabs.
