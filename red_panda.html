        Red pandas live in Nepal's and Myanmar's highlands, as well as central China. 
        Red pandas have a lifespan of eight years in the wild. 
        They are 22 to 24.6 inches long and weighs 12 to 20 pounds. 
        They are slightly larger than a house cat with a bear-like body and thick reddish-brown fur. 
        Their belly, hands and feet are black, with white markings on the sides of their head and eyes. 
        Their long, bushy tail provides balance and is used to cover themselves in the winter. 
        They are herbivores and spend most of their lives in trees.
